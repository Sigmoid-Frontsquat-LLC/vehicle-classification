# vehicle-classification

This repository should have been split into 2 projects but for the sake of simplicity they are together.

# tensorflow
This directory will serve as the location for the python implementation to process the weights we will use later.
Jupyter Notebook will be used if not Visual Studio Code with a Jupyter plugin.

# node-backend
This directory will server as the location for the Node.js logic. Not ideal...for deployment let's use a Makefile.

# unity-frontend
This directory will serve as the actual app starting point for our classification project.
